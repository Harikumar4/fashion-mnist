### 1. Introduction and Objective

**Dataset Description:**  
The Fashion MNIST dataset contains grayscale images of 10 different categories of clothing items, including T-shirts/tops, trousers, pullovers, dresses, coats, sandals, shirts, sneakers, bags, and ankle boots. Each image is represented by 784 pixel values, and the dataset includes a total of 10 classes. The train dataset contains a label column indicating the class of the item, along with 784 pixel values for each image.

**Objective:**  
The objective of this project is to build a neural network model that accurately classifies images in the Fashion MNIST dataset into one of the 10 categories: T-shirts/tops, trousers, pullovers, dresses, coats, sandals, shirts, sneakers, bags, or ankle boots.
